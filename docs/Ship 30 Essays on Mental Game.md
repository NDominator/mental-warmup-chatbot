**There's Not Enough Coaching Education on the Mental Game.**

Most middle school and high school coaches think the mental game is running their athletes until they puke, forcing them to do military style workouts, or pushing them to the point of misery.

## **What if it were different?**

What if we treated the mental game with the same respect as the physical game?

- Intentional drills.
- Planned progression and regression.
- The same level of intent and awareness as our weight room, core, and sprint work.

## **The greatest irony is that coaches LOVE the results of the mental game.**

They just don't know how to teach it, how to improve it, or even what to track.

**Mental Toughness is a competitive advantage… so what is it again?**

Coaches LOVE to talk about mental toughness.

But I think we’re fuzzy on the definition.

Before you start singing the praises of the Black Mamba in Kobe, or the Flu Game and MJ.

What is mental toughness?

## **Mental toughness is a skillset. It’s not just one skill. It’s many.**

This is a good thing! Our job as coaches is to teach, grow, and develop skills (not just physical skills or game skills.)

We develop the whole athlete.

### **What are some mental skills we can work on?**

- Focus
- Resilience
- Preparation
- Rebounding from adversity.
- Emotional Regulation (how to calm yourself down AND ramp yourself up).

This is just a short list. But you’ll notice something… **I didn’t talk about grit, or puking, or pain!**

Because I’d rather have happy, healthy athletes than miserable hurt young people who hate me.

We can work on 70+ other skills first before we go to the extremes.

**Coaches need INTENT when teaching the Mental Game.**

Ask any football coach, what would they rather coach?

Something tangible they can see like blocking or tackling... or intangible like focus?

## **We hear coaching speak all the time:**

- Attention to detail!
- Move with a sense of urgency!
- Hustle to the line!

But how often do we really tell, show, and demonstrate what we want done? Or do we just assume they understand because they say 'YES COACH!'

## **The truth is we can teach focus, but we need to break it down into skills.**

That breakdown requires intent. You can't guess anything about it. You need to know exactly where your athletes are at. Then you have to progress them to the next step.

No passing go. No rushing because you want them to be ahead of the game.

## **They need to earn the right to go forward.**

We do this all the time with physical skills. This is normal.

You don't let a young 12 year old walk into the gym and put 225lbs on the bar for their back squat right away!

You have them build up to that moment: body weight squat, goblet squat, zombie front squat with a PVC pipe, barbell only, then you add weight etc.

Don't make the same mistake with the mental game.

See where they are at, then progress them WITH INTENT.

**Your Loved Ones are Emotionally Hijacking You**

We've all seen a kid look towards the stands, see their parents and wave with a big smile on their face. But what I've seen almost as much is parents quietly hijacking their kids.

I've seen it during:

- Big games.
- Close competitions.
- Scholarship Camps.
- Championship meets.

Your parents just want what's best for you... so how could they be the cause of your stress, pregame anxiety, and at it's worst. **Mom and Dad are the reason you choke?**

While they're cheering you on: *you lose focus.*

When they yell at you to get in position: *you aren't listening to your coach.*

When you are trying to process what they are saying: *you are playing slow.*

They might not mean harm, but every serious athlete needs to have a conversation on what is and isn't good behavior from their parents.

If you are an athlete whose parents are hacking them, you need a specific protocol to defend against parental pressure, lock you in no matter what they say, and allow you to perform your best.

**Don't let your parents in the stands steal away your gold medal moment.**

**Here's How to Handstand Walk across a Tennis Court with One Simple Trick**

One of our pole vaulters was struggling with handstand walking.

He was physically capable, he had the balance and technique down, he had enough endurance. By every visible measure, he had it.

**But what we couldn't see was he doubted himself.**

We'd love to think that wasn't the limiting factor, but the simple fact was he'd never done it before, so he couldn't imagine doing it. He'd get a couple feet and then flop to the floor.

There's two things that can happen here: He can give his brain negative feedback, reinforce his failures, and think I'm never going to make it across the court...

OR

### **We did something radically different.**

We cheered like his life depended on it.I mean, we really hammed it up. You'd have thought if he made it across the court he won a million dollars and so did we. We hooped. We hollered. We cheered. But it was all STRICTLY POSITIVE. No guilt, blame, shame allowed.

Something magical happened between his brain and body--*he kept going.*

He made it farther than he'd ever been before. Now go back up to the top. Was he physically stronger that day vs. any other day? No. Did he magically learn a new technique to balance or grip the ground? No.

He believed it, so he did it. It's that simple.

You perform better when the people around you believe in you.

> When they remove doubt from you, you have no alternative but to succeed.

**Parents in the Stands are Making Their Kids Lose Games**

I’ve seen parents shut their kids down and make them lose a game.

All it took was a single look.

One word.

A sound.

Less than a second and **they're done**.

Focus? Gone.

All that practice. Wasted.

They probably don't even remember their name.

*They've been emotionally hijacked.*

### **What does it look like to be hacked?**

Physiology drives behavior. If a parent says the wrong thing or gives *the look*, your confident happy athlete will crumble right beneath you. Because their body thinks it's in danger if I fail.

Instead of showing up ready to compete they immediately scared, uncertain, and full of doubt. Which is a mental state that will make them lose.

The worst part?

Parents don’t realize it’s happening. They don’t know that they are the problem. They think they are helping. When in reality they are hurting their kids every time they open their mouth.

*So what can you do about it?*

If you’re the athlete: You need to have a way to keep yourself grounded no matter who’s around you. How can you feel safe, secure, stable, and strong no matter what?

If you’re the coach, you need to be aware of what’s happening. When you see your stud getting hacked, have a plan. Be aware. Address it ahead of time.

**The Best Mental Toughness Tool I Teach is The Evidence List**

Your brain has one job. Keep. You. Safe.

It isn't about having you perform the best or even close to optimal. **It's to keep you alive.** That makes fear, uncertainty, and doubt kryptonite to your brain and body.

### **Fear shuts you down.**

We know this when we hear fight, flight, freeze or fawn. Your muscles will be weaker and tight, your reaction time will be slower. No matter how much you practice, when you get emotionally hijacked. You are a worse athlete.

### **Uncertainty makes you fearful of what could happen.**

Because you don't know what's going to happen, there's decision fatigue. If this is late in a game your ability to process and make good decisions goes down the drain. It can be because you are physically tired, but more likely you lose focus and concentration and start to make silly game breaking mistakes.

### **Doubt ruins dreams.**

Doubt has made more athletes quit sports than injuries. Doubt makes you question your identity, the amount of work you've put in, and at it's worst: your worth. If you second guess or doubt yourself in the middle of a play, it is IMPOSSIBLE to make a good play.

You can't play fast, you can't use good technique. You. Are. Scrambled. Eggs.

### **To combat all 3: I teach athletes and coaches how to build an evidence list.**

An evidence list is proof to your brain and body this is who I am. This is normal for me. This is what I'm capable of. Here's how I show up everyday. Why would it be different in a new stadium or a different fieldhouse? The magic in an evidence list is you can use it anytime. Anyday. In any environment and NO ONE KNOWS.

It's the ultimate screwdriver in your mental skills toolkit.

**The First Step to Building Mental Toughness is Document Your Wins**

Yesterday I talked about my favorite mental skills tool in my toolkit: the Evidence List.

An evidence list is a list of proof to your brain and body that you are capable of something. Think of it like your own human highlight reel + identity all wrapped in one.

Only problem is you can't build an evidence list if you don't know your wins.

### **Let's cover how to track and document your wins**

Wins don't have to just be competitions. You can have a best practice, a best rep, a best feeling. All of those count. Improvement is a win. Compliments and good feelings? Those are wins in their own way as well.

Anything that you want to remember when you are feeling fear, uncertainty, and doubt put it down on the wins list.

### **Practically How should you track your wins?**

I have a wins list in a notion doc. Before that I had a Colornote/Apples Note of wins on my phone. You can have it on your phone, in a Google Doc, written down on paper, in a special notebook, or on a bunch of sticky notes in a jar.

The most important part is that you have a place where they are written down, you can access them anywhere and anytime, and you have a routine where they are collected.

At a minimum, track your wins weekly. If you're like me and can't remember what you had for breakfast yesterday, write down your wins daily.

Set an alarm on your phone and track a few down before you go to bed. Then review them the next morning when you get up.

> It's better to start and end your day with a win than doomscrolling on your phone.
> 

**You Can't Out-Think Fear. Here's What To Do Instead**

The biggest misconception that most anxious athletes make is they try to think differently to feel better. It's not their fault. They have well meaning parents, teachers, and coaches telling them: think happy thoughts, try to relax, calm down, drink water, do yoga, on and on it goes.

Stop it. Your brain and body is trying to do it's job keeping you safe.

- You don't outthink anxiety.
- You can't outthink a feeling.

Here's what your loved ones didn't tell you:

> Physiology drives behavior.
> 

Physiology is just a big word for how living things (like you) or body parts work. Your brain has a job. It's number one job is to keep you and your body alive. Do you think you can outthink your brain? NO. It's going to keep you alive.

### **Instead of trying to beat your brain in a battle of wits: hack yourself instead.**

The fastest way to change how you feel when you feel anxious is through your breath. No Wim Hof or Breathe Right strips required.

- If you don't like the way you feel right now: breathe in from your nose, out through your mouth.
- Try to slow down your breathing. Lots of people recommend box breathing. About 2 people ever have been successful in using box breathing to calm down from a panic attack...
- Even simpler, try to breathe in slow, and breathe out even slower. If that's a 2 count and a 4 count, try to make it a 4 and an 8.

### **Most panic gets worse from rapid, shallow, gulping breaths.**

You're panicking so your breathing is panicked, and it makes you feel worse. If you want to feel better, you flip it around. Slow things down to calm down. If a freaked out person takes 16 hyperventilating breaths a minute: take 6 instead. One every 10 seconds.

You can change how you feel instead of trying to outthink the bad feelings.

**Physical Warm ups aren't Enough. You're Missing Half of a Complete Warmup**

Look around any high school sporting event and you'll see athletes warming up.

They're stretching hamstrings, loosening up their throwing arms, and getting their bodies ready to compete. The only problem is most athletes act like a pregame routine is strictly physical.

### **Your nervous system needs a warm up: if you want to perform at your best you need a mental warm up.**

Ask around. What athletes are clear on the mental game before competition?

Do they even know that's something worth paying attention to?

The funny part is the athletes who shrug off the mental game are the exact same ones who lose focus, make the most mistakes, and can't control their emotions. The ones who think they can just win with athleticism get beat by kids with half their talent.

- When they screw up, it's game over.
- When things don't go their way, they get angry and make their teammates worse.
- Their competition knows it too. They know exactly how to hack them, tilt them, and ruin their performance on demand.

> Every pregame should have a physical warmup to get your body right and a mental warmup to get your mind right.
> 

**This is the Most Misunderstood Concept of Mental Warmups**

If you see someone getting ready for a race you can see them physically warm up. You can see them doing sprint drills, leg swings, A skips, jogging laps around a track or inside the infield. What you can't see is what's going on in their head.

*You can't see thoughts and feelings.*

**This is the misconception: that just because you can't see something means someone isn't working.**

The irony is that a mental warmup could be more intense than most average athlete's physical warm up. You aren't ready to compete just because you got a good sweat. Your muscles could be warm and loose, yet your brain can be half asleep.

**It's because of two key ideas: Awareness and Intent.**

Most athletes don't have a mental warm up and their physical warm up is on autopilot. They go through the motions, they do the drills they are told to do, and then they think they are ready to compete. They don't know what they should be doing. They are just doing what they are told.

Knowing what to do is awareness. You know what counts and matters. When you are aware of what you should be doing, you do that thing. You don't waste your time and energy on activities that will make you play worse.

**My warm up and your warmup are NOT the same on purpose!**

Mental warmups are intentional. It's just for you. Not your friend. Not all your teammates. That's why mental warmups look different. Some athletes need to be hyped up and energized to perform. Others need to feel calm and prepared.

> The monk and the maniac should not have the same pregame warmup or they'll both fail.
> 

**Your Maniac and Your Monk Do Not Need the Same Mental Warmup**

We believe everyone is unique until it's time to do unique things at scale. It's the worst part of being a high school coach. How do you have an individual protocol for 10, 50, 100, or even 1000 athletes?

You want everyone to play their best, so what do you do?

### **First off recognize that the Maniac and the Monk are not wired the same way.**

Your maniac might love loud noise, flashing lights, high caffeine, high octane, and tons of crowd interaction. They need a lot of stimulus to get going and they feed off that energy.

Your monk would crumple in that same environment. They are all about feeling calm, ready, and prepared for the task at hand.

It doesn't have to be meditation in silence, but if they had the same pregame as the maniac they'd be overstimulated. Being too high means it's easy to make mistakes. Mistakes snowball and then you feel frazzled.

### **Your Mental Warmup is Crucial to The Start of Your Competition**

In a game like football there might be time to recover from a bad warmup.

Track and Field? The race can be done in less than 11 seconds. You only get so many throws or jumps. Make it and advance, miss and you're done. A bad physical warmup is one thing, but a mental one and it's like you aren't even out there competing. You could look dead asleep or be too anxious and false start.

**Get HYPED Doesn't Work For Every Athlete**

> GET HYPED! BRING THE JUICE! GET UP IT'S GAMEDAY!
> 

That's what they tell everyone in team sports.

But here's what they don't tell you:

**High energy ≠ High performance**

I watched a goalie last week:

- Team was screaming
- Music was blasting
- Everyone jumping around

His response?

3 mistakes in the first 5 minutes.

Why?

He was overstimulated.

Adding more 'hype' was like adding gasoline to a fire.

The best athletes don't get 'pumped up.'

They get 'dialed in.'

Big difference.

What gets YOU dialed in?

**Coaches Destroy their Team's Confidence Everyday in A Stupid Way**

Confidence is king. You don't see elite level performances without some level of confidence. If we could bottle it and give it away on the street, it'd be one of the most consumed drugs known to man.

All that said, and coaches suck the life out of kids when they do this:

### **They expect perfect execution with no teaching and then immediately punish mistakes.**

Go to any youth practice you'll see exercise used as punishment.

- Football loves up-downs.
- Baseball loves pole runs.

When in doubt there's some combination of wall sits, pushups, mountain climbers, or running. The key problem is that these punishment exercises are used for mistakes.

### **This is bad coaching. This isn't teaching. This is stupid.**

An 8 year old is not a professional athlete. I can guarantee you, they will drop the ball if you throw it at them. You have to teach how to catch. You can't use big words to try and sound smart. You can't use jargon. If you even use the word trajectory or velocity you deserve a ball at high velocity towards your face.

### **When you teach athletes as kids that making mistakes means punishment, they won't take risks.**

They won't try. They'll play tight, scared, hesitant, and slow. If they have to think about what's going to happen if I fail: they'll fail. They lost before the game's started. Do that for too long and they'll just quit.

You can't punish a kid and make them do exercises from your bad coaching job. If you want confident, skilled, excellent athletes: teach them exactly how you want them to play.

When they make a mistake, show them what you want them to do instead. Give them the opportunity to fail in practice, then let them grow and get better. If you expect them to perform in a game when they can't do it in practice: you're delusional.

**If Your Athletes Can't Flip the Switch on to Compete: They need a Mental Warmup**

One of the biggest problems that coaches complain about with their athletes is that they don't know how to flip the switch. They don't know how to go from being a student in the classroom to being confident and dominant as an athlete in their sport.

### **This isn't the athlete's fault. They were never taught.**

It's a skill to know how to flip the switch. Coaches just expect them to know how to do it automatically, especially if this was easy for them as an athlete. Like the second you strap on a football helmet, you become a different person and are born ready to play. But in reality, it's something that they need to teach.

### **The way I teach this is through a mental warm-up.**

You need to understand that competing is a different mental state from sitting in a classroom and learning. You need a way to quickly shift almost your whole identity. The emotional state you're in, the mental state you're in, the way you physically feel have to be different. When you play your sport, you can't just be a nice polite schoolboy and then also hit that killer game winning shot. Those are not the same people. Little quiet Susie from chemistry class doesn't just play smothering defense.

### **How do you make the switch?**

The first thing you need to understand is awareness. You have to do something different and it's not just instant. You don't just snap your fingers and turn into an animal. We need to ramp up the same way we physically warm up: go simple to complex, slow to fast.

### **We need an emotional ramp up.**

We need to have an emotional state that gets you into the competitive mindset. Once you understand that there's a process to doing this, then you can teach it and you get more consistent results.

**This is what eliminates those games where your team comes out flat and looks like they are half asleep.**

The truth is, there was no mental warm-up, they never made the transition. They never turned it on. And in sports, where a match could be over in seconds, like a wrestling match or a track race. It's even more important that you have a mental warm up because you don't have time to make up for mistakes. You have to be on the second the gun goes off or the whistle blows.

**I Missed Coaching Moments Everyday Because I Lacked This One Thing.**

There are more coaching moments than just on the field, during practice, and in games. The easiest way to add more opportunities to improve and coach your players: **be aware**. If I had tattoos, one forearm would be 'awareness', the other 'intent'.

### **How do you build awareness?**

You start by understanding everything matters or nothing matters. If nothing matters to you, quit coaching. If everything matters, then we can start paying attention to the things we've been missing.

- Do you notice how every season at about the same time this kid gets sick? Why is that?
- Do you notice how a certain player responds when they make a mistake? Does it make more sense when you meet their parents for the first time?
- Do you notice the whole team gets really sloppy at the same time during practice? Or after a specific drill? Vs. when they do this other thing they all play with more energy and sharper?

There's coaching opportunities everywhere. But you have to open your eyes and start connecting dots. That's a skill. It's a skill to ask the question: why is that happening? What am I missing? What don't I know?

If something keeps popping up and you don't like it. You can change it. But you can't do anything about it if you aren't aware of what's happening around you. This is how you start playing the mental game. When you make the connection of seeing something is happeniing and taking control over what you can control to fix it.

**Consistent vs. Streaky Teams: What's The Hidden Difference?**

At this point, coaches should know that a complete warmup is both physical and mental. If you find your team is really hot one week and then comes out ice cold the next... we've got a problem. The problem that I see too often is a lack of understanding on state.

You know about the three states of matter? Solid, liquid, and gas?

**What about the states of an athlete before, during, and after a game?**

- Before a game: you don't know what's going to happen. There's energy, excitement, anxiousness, uncertainty, and maybe a little doubt.
- During a game: it's happening. You need to be engaged and present. If you are worried, distracted, or full of doubt... not a good place to be.
- After the game is reflection: What just happened. How do I feel about it? What can I change?

You can't treat these three states the same.

### **We also have a physical state, an emotional state, spiritual state, and mental state.**

Again, most teams only warmup one way. They cover the physical state with a dynamic warmup. (You have moved on from static stretching at this point right? RIGHT?)

We can't just cover one state and think, yup. My team is 100% ready to play.

If there's a gap, if there's a mismatch, if your team has never been taught to handle these other components of competing. That's why you see this roller coaster of one week we are ON. Lights out, can't do anything wrong. The next it's full of disappointment and frustration.

> If you are laying awake at night wondering if you should even coach anymore from your streaky team, you need to be aware of these concepts.
> 

You're probably 10 uncomfortable conversations, a mental warmup, and a walkthrough away from a consistent higher performing team.

**Why Do Your Athletes Get Stuck in Their Head Instead of Playing In Flow?**

We all know what the flow state feels like, it's the best experience in sports.

Everything feels easy, effortless, and it's almost like the game is playing you instead of you playing the game. We'd love to be in flow all the time. So why aren't we? What's going wrong? Is there something we should be on the lookout for?

Flow can't happen if there's a mismatch between challenge and skill, if you're distracted, if there's unclear goals or direction, and most underrated: if there's under or over arousal.

### **What if we have a mental warmup that checks these boxes?**

- We can be prepared and ready to meet any challenge (we call that good coaching).
- We can teach our team how to be focused on what they can control.
- We can have clear instruction and complete clarity on our mission.
- We can get in the correct state to perform.

If this feels like a Flow Formula, you're right! Take the things that make flow impossible and remove them. Take the best experiences you've had playing, or times where you've been in the zone and repeat them.

Getting in the zone then becomes a habit, not a fleeting once in a lifetime experience.

**Coaches: Thinking is the Fastest Way to Slow Down Good Players**

Wanna screw up your athletes? Make them think, uncertain, fearful, and full of doubt.

Want them to play better? *Flip those all around.*

Play fast and free. Almost effortless. Playful. No thoughts behind those eyes, just instinct and pattern recognition. Play behind your preparation, your readiness, your film study.

Play confident, happy, and certain of what you are capable, what your role is, and where you are supposed to be.

Coaches will say OF COURSE I want my players to be this way... But why don't they perform the way you want them to?

**It's a mismatch between what you teach them and what you say in the moment.**

If your quarterback throws an interception, it's a bad read, play, and decision and you yell at him from the time he threw the ball, till he got on the sideline, and even on the bench you are still purple. Do you think he'll risk making a mistake again?

No. He'll be thinking. Don't do this again. If I make a mistake, I'm going to get yelled at.

If I take a risk, it's not worth the reward. Then he'll play tight, safe, and the exact opposite of how you taught him.

It's impossible to play in the flow state when you're afraid and thinking.

Don't mess up your players because of YOUR emotions. YOUR inability to regulate yourself.

I have beef with superstitions in athletics.
Too many athletes and coaches are giving their power away to them.
This doesn't help you.
It's building one giant fragile crutch.

If things don't go exactly your way, you're done.

If you need to have your perfect Subway Sandwich + the right flavor of Gatorade, warm up exactly one hour and fifteen minutes before the games starts or you won't play at your best.

You're a soft athlete.
You will get beat by athletes that are cluesless about the mental game.
They just go play!

How do we flip this around?
How can we put our faith in things that are under our control. Not lucky underwear.

Here's how:

First. How do YOU want to feel?

Some athletes want to be calm and ready.
Others wanna be maniacs. All jacked up and energized.

You need to decide ahead of time how you play best.

Second: How do you get into that state?
The fastest way to change your physiology is through your breath.

If you need to calm down fast, you slow down your breathing, you inhale through your nose only. You exhale even slower.

If you need to get ramped up, it starts nasal in and out, but you start to transition to power breaths. You might ramp up all the way to in through your mouth and out through your mouth.

Breathing Gears from ShiftAdapt are worth looking into.

Okay great, you told me to breathe.
Real genius work here.

What else can I do?

You can create instant triggers. This isn't something you learn to do on gameday.
It's something you build through practice and reps.

The easiest triggers you felt are all sensory:
There's a specific smell of a basketball gym vs. a grass soccer field vs. an artificial turf football field.

There's a specific feeling of putting your shoes, cleats, or spikes on.
Your walk literally is different than just before in casual shoes.
Sounds and smells work FAST. They shortcut your thinking brain.
That's why movie theater popcorn is so visceral.
Music works FAST.

The difference is being intentional about using these senses.

If you know you have a song that gets you in the zone.
You don't play that an hour and a half before the game starts.
You just wasted that feeling, that energy.
Bad, bad, no good.

Again, music can get you in a state immediately.

If you don't like the way you feel, use an instant trigger to change it.
You're in control.
If you feel tired and lethargic before a game: have YOUR song that hacks you into having more energy.
If you are too amped up and anxious, have the song that YOU know calms you down.

I can't tell you which songs, because they have to resonate and work for you. It's like trying to tell you that my favorite flavor of ice cream is the only flavor you should eat.

Third: Practice and Iterate.
You have to test and tinker and try.
This is not something you do once and go. AH it doesn't work for me.

Keep trying things and see what works best for YOU.

This is what you do instead of using superstitions as a crutch.
No lucky underwear required. No bleached hair and scraggly beards.

You take control of you.
You take control of how you feel.
It's a skill that you get better at over time.

**Stop Worrying about the Competition, Focus on this Instead**

Anxious athletes worry about the competition.

They worry about how they'll perform.

How they'll be seen.

They worry about all the things BESIDES the things under their control. An internal Locus of Control is a must have for confident athletes. You have to believe that it's up to you. That you control how you feel, no one else does. No one deserves the right to take your power away.

Instead of worrying about things outside of your control: what are 3 inputs that you have total control over?

- You control your level of preparation. You can show up early, you can warm up on time, you can have scouted ahead of time, watched film, gotten a good night's sleep, fueled your body, and hydrated well.
- You control your emotions, your emotions don't control you. If you feel anxious or nervous, you can ground yourself. You can breathe in specific ways to calm yourself down. You can review your evidence list, your highlight reel, you can know this is no different than what you've done all week in practice.

The key difference here is your focus has to shift from outside of you, the crowd, the weather, the refs, to what do I have control over?

Start by picking a few things and focus on those, see how you feel and perform. It's a simple tweak, but it's a gamechanger.

**Your Coaching Is Only Good if Your Athletes Feel Safe**

**Your brain's job is not performance, it's survival.**

Bad coaches don't understand this and you see it everyday. If there was a top ten list of things NOT to do, they hit all 10. Here's a few simple examples.

- They cause physical harm with dangerous conditioning.
- They breakdown players, but they never build them back up.
- They create environments filled with fear, doubt, guilt, blame, shame, and uncertainty.
- There's no teaching of fundamental skills, no player development or skill acqusition.

All of these things add up. There's lasting damage from bad coaching. It destroys the love of the sport, it leaves kids injured, and it teaches them that we don't care about you. We just care if you play well, score, and win for us.

If you want mentally strong athletes, you have to be sure that your coaching isn't a threat to their system. If it is, they won't learn, they won't listen. They'll be anxious, afraid of making a mistake, play tight, scared, and slow.

Stop thinking they are wired for performance. They aren't. They are wired to survive.

What are some common ways we accidentally hack our athletes?
Communication is a big one.
Yelling, criticism, humiliation, guilt, blame, and shame are not going to help your athletes.
Their systems will take that input as a threat.

Athletes dont' perform well when threatened. They perform like feral animals: scared, on guard, defensive, tight, reactive, and with tunnel vision.

Is that what you want your athletes to look like on game day? Deer in the Headlights or Scared Cat clawing everyone in a corner at the vets office?

No! That's not what you practice either.
For your athletes to perform at their best, for them to be in the zone, to experience flow, they can't be afraid of you.
They can't be afraid of the consequences of what happens if they make a mistake.
They can't be worried about the yelling that's happening as they jog to the sideline with their head down.
That's bad coaching.

What does good coaching look like?
What's a safe environment?

I'll tell you this: most kids never experience an environment where it is not just okay, but acceptable and necessary to make a mistake.

They are absolutely TERRIFIED of failure.
It's drilled into them young to be 'perfect'.
We're not robots. We're human. We will make errors. We will make mistakes. It's a 100% certainty.

To learn you have to make mistakes.
Take something simple like a hurdle hop or a box jump.

Did every athlete ever do it correctly on the first try?
NO.
Now here's the important part: did you allow their friends, buddies, teammates, or worst OTHER COACHES to make fun of them or tease the hell out of them when they fell?

If you did. That's bad coaching.
That's teaching someone young and early, do not make a mistake or else you'll be embarassed.

Embarassed players don't play fast, free, and have fun.
They play like their trying not to get pant-sed.
What happens to those players?
They make a mistake anyway. They get Mossed. They get joked.
And then they shuffle to the bench thinking I did it again. I always do it.
The feedback loop reinforces itself.
We have to make practice the place we make mistakes.
Do we love a clean and technical walkthrough on Thursdays the night before games? Of course we do.

It's fun to have practices where the ball never touches the ground and everything feels easy.

But to get to that point, you have to be willing to make mistakes.
You have to learn how to run that route, where you need to be, where you need to look, how to get out of your break, where your eyes need to be when the balls in the air, what part of the ball you focus on through the catch, how to accept contact and not crumple or lose concentration...

On and on it goes. Each of those are skills. No one has every skilled maxed out to 99's as a 14-18 year old.

They have to be taught. They need reps. They need coaching and practice.
They're still kids.

The biggest coaching reminder for me this week:
Stability is reflexive.
You can't think or cue your way to stable.
It's a nervous system thing.

So what do you do about it?
You go from receptors all the way to your cortex and check your work along the way.

If someone can't balance on one foot for 5 seconds, there's a problem that needs solving.

It might be a gait issue, it might be a vestibular problem, their vision could be causing it.

Again, most coaches think like Meatheads. We must hammer muscles and joints and tendons and ligaments RAH! That'll fix dumb problem!
But it won't. It can't.

This isn't something you throw another 3x10 exercise at.
You have to be aware of what's going on.
Can they touch their finger to their nose the same way with their left as their right?
What about with their eyes closed 👀?

If they can't, there's a problem.
There's an opportunity to get better.
The exciting part is that the fix can be fast and easy.
It might be a march.
It might be an eye isometrics.
But you have to be aware these tools are in the tool box.
If not, you're screwed.

The whole point of this thread is that you can't neglect the nervous system. It's a mental game as much as a physical one.

There's things going on, you just need to learn how to be aware, what to look for, and what interventions to try.

The first 3 things you try might not work.
4 might kinda help, 5 might make it worse, and then the 7th thing nails it spot on.

# I'm just trying to be the coach I wish I had growing up.
That's on everything.

I didn't have a real sprints workout until my freshman year in college.

I lifted more in Summer Gym than I ever did for track practice.

The only time we were in the weight room for track was once a year during spring break practices...

There's this wild double standard when you're a top student and an athlete.

There's this idea that everything in the classroom is easy.

I'd like to remind you that academic stress is stress. It has an impact on your body.

I wish a single coach before college would've asked hey, uh you're sick a lot...

You good?

Has it always been this way?

It is mind boggling that there wasn't a single conversation between two sports and 6 years about this.

I wish someone would've pulled me aside at the first injury and said hey, we screwed up. Not you.

This is not your fault. This is our fault. And here's what we're going to do to fix it together so it's never a problem again.

The mental and emotional side of sport was not talked about, taught, or recognized whatsoever besides nonsense posters on the wall and generic platitudes.

In fact, middle school football the question everyday from the head coach was
"Are you satisfied?"
No.
"Are you satisfied?"
No.
"Well you can't be."

To the point of after we won the championship and was celebrating we still responded in line.

The coaches were confused that the brainwashing had worked...

So much unnecessary pain and suffering could have been prevented.

This is something people realize when they become parents for the first time and would never consider treating their kids the way they were treated.

None of this stuff is 'hard'.
It doesn't even take much time.
You just have to care.

I really cared about sports. I had loyalty to my schools.
I wanted to work hard for my coaches, my teammates.
I did whatever I was told and more.

But sports isn't just physical.
It's mental.

And the sad truth is there's 10 uncomfortable conversations keeping teams from reaching their ultimate goal.

There's 3 systems or protocols that if they put in place, lives are literally changed and saved.

But we'd rather say that's someone else's job or there was no way to know.

If you want to destroy someone for life, you destroy their mental game when they are young and believe everything that you say and don't know any better.

If you want to teach strong resilient unbelievably talented athletes how to reach their dreams.
You empower them.
You believe in them.

And you tell them exactly how to reach that next step with clarity.
And that you'll be with them every step of the way.
